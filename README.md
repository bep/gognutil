# gognutil

This isn't necessarily very useful, just a placeholder project for Go implementations of some of the [GNU Core Utils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).

The functionality should be very similar, the implementation very different (I haven't looked too close). It's not tuned and can surely be improved. PRs are welcome!

As you see below, this project just started -- and will probably never be complete.

For a similar project with lots of these util implemented in Go, see [go-coreutils](https://github.com/aisola/go-coreutils).
