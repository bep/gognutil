# gognutil

This isn't necessarily very useful, just a placeholder project for Go implementations of some of the [GNU Core Utils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).

The functionality should be very similar, the implementation very different (I haven't looked too close). It's not tuned and can surely be improved. PRs are welcome!
